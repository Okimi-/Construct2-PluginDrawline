# Construct2-PluginDrawline
Pluging for Construct2 for drawing lines at runtime

* Download drawline.c2addon and install it in Construct2 simply by drag & drop.
* Download DrawLine-Exemple.capx to look an exemple of using this pluging

Have fun and send me your game screen shoots, i'm curious to see the using of this plugin.

PS: You must set "Enable WebGL" to Off, in the Layout/Configuration Settings to see lines.
